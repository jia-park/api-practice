## Setting Up Sudo Access on Ubuntu
In Ubuntu and other Linux distributions, the sudo command empowers users to execute commands with the security privileges of another user, typically the superuser or root. However, not all users are initially granted permission to use sudo.

## Granting Sudo Access
To grant a user permission to use sudo, they must be added to the sudoers list, which is managed by the visudo command, editing the /etc/sudoers file. This file specifies which users or groups are permitted to execute commands with sudo.

## How to Add User to Sudoers List
1. Open a terminal window.
2. Type sudo visudo and press Enter. You may be prompted to enter your password.
3. This command opens the sudoers file in a text editor (vi or nano). Using visudo is crucial to avoid syntax errors.
4. Navigate to the section defining user privileges, often denoted by %sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL, granting sudo access to sudo group members.
5. To add your user account, insert a line similar to %sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL, replacing %sudo with your username (e.g., user ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL).
6. Save the file and exit the text editor (in vi, press Esc, then type :wq and press Enter; in nano, press Ctrl + O to save, then Ctrl + X to exit).
7. Your user account should now have sudo privileges. You may need to log out and log back in for changes to take effect.
